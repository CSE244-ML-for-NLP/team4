HK comments on canvas project proposal (in gradebook):
	You could include the depiction you used in the presentation here and your final report as well, as it was useful.
	What dataset will you use in the experiments? How large is it? etc.
	I'd consider RNNs, as audio has temporal nature.
	Please start thinking about the baseline approach, evaluation measure, and a review of previous work on this topic.
