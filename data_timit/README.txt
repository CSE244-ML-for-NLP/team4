Please download the TIMIT dataset from
https://www.kaggle.com/mfekadu/darpa-timit-acousticphonetic-continuous-speech
 and unzip directly into the 'data_timit' directory.  If you've got the directory structure correct, the path 'data_timit/data/TRAIN' will exist.

If you already have TIMIT, you can just point `TIMIT_DATA_DIR` in 'timit_loader.py' to TIMIT's 'data' directory.
